<h1>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</h1>
<p>Rock paper scissors lizard spock is fully responsive JavaScript game that is similar to the well-known game rock, paper, scissors but has two extra weapons called lizard and spock! The game is most commonly associated with the US sitcom The Big Bang Theory but it was actually invented by Sam Kass, according to the official website.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>The home page for the game consists of a header with the name of the game at the top. It has two options in the middle container of the page; the first is the Start game option that brings the user to the game and the other option is the Rules section that explains the rules to the user.</p>
<p>The game itself also consists of a header. The game takes place in the centre container on this page. The game is divided into three areas; the score area, the controls area and the details area. 
<li>The score area is the area that counts the score from 0 to 5 for the user and the PC.</li>
<li>The controls area is in the middle of the page and consists of the five buttons that the user chooses from to play the game.</li>
<li>The details area displays whether the user or the PC won each individual game.</li>
</p>

<h3>Features Left to Implement:</h3>
<p>I would like to add a feature that allows the user to play against another player online.</p>

<h3>Validator Testing</h3>
<li><strong>HTML: </strong>No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.</li>
<li><strong>CSS: </strong>No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator</li>
<li><strong>Javascript: </strong>When I inputted the javascipt to JsJint, there was a couple of missing semi-colons. I corrected these and there was no other errors.</li>

<h3>Testing:</h3>
<p>I tested the game using Lighthouse to make sure that it performs sufficiently. I also used the inspect tool to make sure that the game is responsive for all devices.</p>
